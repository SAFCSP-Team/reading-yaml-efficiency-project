# Parsing YAML Project
### Objective
These projects aim to practice algorithms and analyze their time and space complexity.

<hr>

### Tokenizer YAML file 
#### Problem
You have a YAML file `example.yml` which contains: 
```
name:ProjectOne
version:1
```
You're required to read the file `example.yml` and store it in an array or linked list, but don't store the colon ":", then print it. 

The output should be: 
```
'name', 'ProjectOne', 'version', '1'
```

#### Implementation


#### Qualification to pass
 - [ ] The code should run successfully.
 - [ ] The output should match the expected output.

<hr>

### Parsing project
#### Problem
You're required to print the `tokenizer` content, but the output should be as follows:
```
key:name
value:ProjectOne
key:version
value:1
```

#### Implementation

#### Quaification to pass
 - [ ] The code should run successfully.
 - [ ] The output should match the expected output.

### Search an element in the YAML file

#### Problem
You're required to build a search function that takes one parameter a string type. 

Finally, write the time complexity and space complexity of the function as a comment above the function. 

#### Implementation

#### Quaification to pass
 - [ ] The code should run successfully.
 - [ ] The time complexity and space complexity should be correct.
